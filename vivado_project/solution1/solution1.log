@E [SYNCHK-41] fpga_top.cpp:106: unsupported pointer reinterpretation from type 'i32*' to type 'i8*' on variable 'DRAM'.
@E [SYNCHK-11] fpga_top.cpp:106: Argument 'DRAM' has an unsynthesizable type 'i32*' (possible cause(s): structure variable cannot be decomposed due to (1) unsupported type conversion; (2) memory copy operation; (3) function pointer used in struct; (4) unsupported pointer comparison).
@E [SYNCHK-11] fpga_top.cpp:107: Constant 'DRAM_WEIGHTS' has an unsynthesizable type 'floatP*' (possible cause(s): pointer to pointer or global pointer).
@E [SYNCHK-22] fpga_top.cpp:112: memory copy is not supported unless used on bus interface possible cause(s): non-static/non-constant local array with initialization).
