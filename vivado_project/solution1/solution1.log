@W [SYNCHK-77] The top function 'fpga_top' (fpga_top.cpp:375) has no outputs. Possible cause(s) are: (1) Output parameters are passed by value; (2) intended outputs (parameters or global variables) are never written; (3) there are infinite loops.
@I [SYNCHK-10] 0 error(s), 1 warning(s).
@E [XFORM-801] Interface parameter bitwidth 'DRAM_LAYERCONFIG.type' (fpga_top.cpp:380:1) must be a multiple of 8 for AXI4 master port.
